# TradePro - Render Deployment Guide

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
Your project is already configured with the necessary files:
- `Procfile` - Tells Render how to start your app
- `build.sh` - Handles the build process
- `pyproject.toml` - Contains all dependencies
- `render.yaml` - Render configuration

### 2. Deploy to Render

1. **Create Render Account**
   - Go to https://render.com
   - Sign up with GitHub (recommended)

2. **Connect Your Repository**
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select this repository

3. **Configure Deployment Settings**
   ```
   Name: tradepro-bot
   Environment: Python 3
   Build Command: chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
   Start Command: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --threads 2 --timeout 120 main:app
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   Add these in Render dashboard:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL = (auto-generated by Render PostgreSQL)
   SESSION_SECRET = (generate random string)
   ```

### 3. Add Database (Optional but Recommended)
1. In Render dashboard, click "New +" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Name: `tradepro-db`
3. Copy the database URL to your web service environment variables

### 4. Configure Telegram Alerts (Optional)
If you want Telegram notifications, add:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = your_chat_id
```

## Important Notes

- **Free Tier**: Render's free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Cold Starts**: First request may take 30-60 seconds after sleeping
